# VGSI Front End Code Challenge

Fork this repo and write rest of your code within that forked repo.

1. Get a react app started using `create-react-app`.

2. Use the [Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) API to fetch a list of images using
	 the appropriate api. Using the data returned from that endpoint, make an index
	 page that shows a UI card containing the picture and the name of the author.

	 Feel free to use the `material-ui`
	 [Card](https://material-ui.com/components/cards/). Or use that as a jumping
	 off point to code your own using CSS. 

3. Setup a router and create a show page component, so that I can click on the
	 pictures's card in the UI and view more specific details, such as the native height
	 and width and any other relavant information.

Please *do not* spend more than 2 hours on this coding challenge. I'm more
interested in seeing how you would go about approaching this problem and our
conversation about your code after.
